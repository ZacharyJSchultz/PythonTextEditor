# PythonTextEditor
A basic text editor coded in Python using tkinter. Contains a save button, clear button, and a scrollbar. Coded on mac, haven't tested on Windows (yet).

Used this tutorial as a guide:  https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/text-editor-notepad-project-python/

Going to add more to this project when I get more free time.
